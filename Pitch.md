# **Xealth Project**

- Summary of idea.

The utilization of digital tools by healthcare providers has experienced significant acceleration as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, Xealth, a company based in Seattle, collaborated with Cerner, a prominent electronic health record company, to assist hospitals in implementing digital health programs.

Following a recent audit, several internal processes and systems were identified as requiring revision. Our team has been engaged to deliver continuous cyber security monitoring and incident response services to Xealth as its platform expands.

- Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition.
What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for implementing the objectives at Xealth includes the proper implementation of Identity and Access Management (IAM) using AWS best practices, a CIS-compliant Windows Server Domain Controller (DC), a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) or log aggregation system for centralized monitoring and analysis of security events, network traffic monitoring solutions for detecting potential threats, and the implementation of Data Loss Prevention (DLP) controls to prevent unauthorized data leakage and protect sensitive information. This MVP aims to establish a solid foundation for cybersecurity and compliance at Xealth by addressing key objectives such as secure team member access, server security, centralized monitoring, network security, and data protection.
