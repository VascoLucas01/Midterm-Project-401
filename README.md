# XEALTH-Project

## Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly accelerated the adoption of digital tools by healthcare providers. In 2020, Seattle-based company Xealth teamed up with Cerner, a leading electronic health record company, to work with hospitals on implementing digital health programs.

Due to a recent audit, a number of internal processes and systems were found to be in need of revision. Our team has been contracted to provide ongoing cyber security monitoring and incident response services to Xealth as its platform grows.
