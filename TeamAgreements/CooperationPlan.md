Vasco: Research, Persistent, Enthusiast.

José: Communication.

- How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

Vasco: Always ask if they need help, give suggestions and welcome them too in order to allow a good flow of the project and team work.

José: I'll use my communication skills in the presentation of the project and in the future in order for my ideas to be listened and easily understand.

- In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?

Guilherme: Communicate more precisely.

Vasco: Self Confidence, keep calm.

José: Leadership. Not saying that I don't have any sense of leadership, but if I was a great leader combined with my communication skills I would be a valuable asset for any company.

- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

A private channel/group was created in Slack and Discord in order to communicate and update every idea or improvements about the project. In fact, the schedules of each one of the elements of the group are quite different, but we already talked and everyday we’re going to give feedback and try to ensure that all the work is done with all the presence of all the elements.

We will make sure that everyone is on board with every step of the project, having either worked on it or at least understood what was done by the other colleague every time there is a github commit or a decision was taken.
